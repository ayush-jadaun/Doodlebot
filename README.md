## Aim
This project aims to use OpenCV, NumPy, and Python to create a bot capable of identifying and drawing patterns on the ground using an attached marker.

## Why?
This project was developed to compete in the MNNIT's Avishkar Tech Fest under the Robotics Club. I was responsible for developing the software required for it.

## How can you use it?
Install Python: Ensure Python is installed on your machine.

Install Required Libraries:

NumPy

OpenCV

Use this command to install the libraries:

pip install numpy opencv-contrib-python
Fork and Clone the Repository: Fork this repository and clone it to your machine.

Update File Directories: Change the file directory of images or any other necessary paths as required.

## Note:
If it doesn't work for the photo you choose, the problem is likely with the dictionary. Update that accordingly.
